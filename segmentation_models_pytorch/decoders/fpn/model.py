class FPN(SegmentationModel):
    """FPN_ is a fully convolution neural network for image semantic segmentation.

    Args:
        encoder_name: Name of the classification model that will be used as an encoder (a.k.a backbone)
            to extract features of different spatial resolution
        encoder_depth: A number of stages used in encoder in range [3, 5]. Each stage generate features
            two times smaller in spatial dimensions than previous one (e.g. for depth 0 we will have features
            with shapes [(N, C, H, W),], for depth 1 - [(N, C, H, W), (N, C, H // 2, W // 2)] and so on).
            Default is 5
        encoder_weights: One of **None** (random initialization), **"imagenet"** (pre-training on ImageNet) and
            other pretrained weights (see table with available weights for each encoder_name)
        decoder_pyramid_channels: A number of convolution filters in Feature Pyramid of FPN_
        decoder_segmentation_channels: A number of convolution filters in segmentation blocks of FPN_
        decoder_merge_policy: Determines how to merge pyramid features inside FPN. Available options are **add**
            and **cat**
        decoder_dropout: Spatial dropout rate in range (0, 1) for feature pyramid in FPN_
        in_channels: A number of input channels for the model, default is 3 (RGB images)
        classes: A number of classes for output mask (or you can think as a number of channels of output mask)
        activation: An activation function to apply after the final convolution layer.
            Available options are **"sigmoid"**, **"softmax"**, **"logsoftmax"**, **"tanh"**, **"identity"**,
                **callable** and **None**.
            Default is **None**
        upsampling: Final upsampling factor. Default is 4 to preserve input-output spatial shape identity
        aux_params: Dictionary with parameters of the auxiliary output (classification head). Auxiliary output is build
            on top of encoder if **aux_params** is not **None** (default). Supported params:
                - classes (int): A number of classes
                - pooling (str): One of "max", "avg". Default is "avg"
                - dropout (float): Dropout factor in [0, 1)
                - activation (str): An activation function to apply "sigmoid"/"softmax"
                    (could be **None** to return logits)

    Returns:
        ``torch.nn.Module``: **FPN**
