class PSPNet(SegmentationModel):
    """PSPNet_ is a fully convolution neural network for image semantic segmentation. Consist of 
    *encoder* and *Spatial Pyramid* (decoder). Spatial Pyramid build on top of encoder and does not 
    use "fine-features" (features of high spatial resolution). PSPNet can be used for multiclass segmentation
    of high resolution images, however it is not good for detecting small objects and producing accurate, pixel-level mask. 

    Args:
        encoder_name: Name of the classification model that will be used as an encoder (a.k.a backbone)
            to extract features of different spatial resolution
        encoder_depth: A number of stages used in encoder in range [3, 5]. Each stage generate features 
            two times smaller in spatial dimensions than previous one (e.g. for depth 0 we will have features
            with shapes [(N, C, H, W),], for depth 1 - [(N, C, H, W), (N, C, H // 2, W // 2)] and so on).
            Default is 5
        encoder_weights: One of **None** (random initialization), **"imagenet"** (pre-training on ImageNet) and 
            other pretrained weights (see table with available weights for each encoder_name)
        psp_out_channels: A number of filters in Spatial Pyramid
        psp_use_batchnorm: If **True**, BatchNorm2d layer between Conv2D and Activation layers
            is used. If **"inplace"** InplaceABN will be used, allows to decrease memory consumption.
            Available options are **True, False, "inplace"**
        psp_dropout: Spatial dropout rate in [0, 1) used in Spatial Pyramid
        in_channels: A number of input channels for the model, default is 3 (RGB images)
        classes: A number of classes for output mask (or you can think as a number of channels of output mask)
        activation: An activation function to apply after the final convolution layer.
            Available options are **"sigmoid"**, **"softmax"**, **"logsoftmax"**, **"tanh"**, **"identity"**, **callable** and **None**.
            Default is **None**
        upsampling: Final upsampling factor. Default is 8 to preserve input-output spatial shape identity
        aux_params: Dictionary with parameters of the auxiliary output (classification head). Auxiliary output is build 
            on top of encoder if **aux_params** is not **None** (default). Supported params:
                - classes (int): A number of classes
                - pooling (str): One of "max", "avg". Default is "avg"
                - dropout (float): Dropout factor in [0, 1)
                - activation (str): An activation function to apply "sigmoid"/"softmax" (could be **None** to return logits)

    Returns:
        ``torch.nn.Module``: **PSPNet**
