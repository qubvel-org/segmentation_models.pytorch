# Hall of Fame

`Segmentation Models` package is widely used in the image segmentation competitions.
Here you can find competitions, names of the winners and links to their solutions.

Please, follow these rules, when adding a solution to the "Hall of Fame":

1. Solution should be high rated (e.g. for Kaggle gold or silver medal) 
2. There should be a description of the solution (post at the forum / code / blog post / paper / pre-print)
